    <h2><b>Why It Is Called Ice Cream</b></h2>
    <p>A long time ago, people used ice to cool down sweet cream or custard in order to make ice cream. It was named "iced cream". It then changed into "ice cream" in 1744.</p>
    <h2><b>The History</b></h2>
    <p>Nobody really knows who really made ice cream. </p>
    <h2><b>Kinds Of Ice Cream</b></h2>
    <p>There are many different kinds of ice cream. A few most known ones are mochi, gelato, soft serve, and sherbert.</p>
    <h2><b>Flavors</b></h2>
    <p> The flavors most people know are vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Flavors of ice cream are not just limited to those three. There are also special kinds of ice cream that you didn't know about. For example, I once tried pig feet ice cream. I was really excited about trying it out because it was a combiniation of two of may favorite things, pig feet and ice cream. It turns out that it wasn't very good. In the website <a href="https://gastronomica.org/2002/05/05/asparagus-ice-cream-anyone/">Asparagus Ice Cream, Anyone?</a> it says that there is artichoke ice cream!
